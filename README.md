## Potential future improvements
- Load any midi from storage
- Extend later into a hurdy gurdy simulator where Playdate keys are used to finger notes.

This project is built off of SquidGodDev's very nifty [playdate-template](https://github.com/SquidGodDev/playdate-template) and SDK "MIDIPlayer" example.
